## Why? [![start with why](https://img.shields.io/badge/start%20with-why%3F-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](http://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action)

As a student studying Data Science but passionate about Computer Science, I thought it would be beneficial to learn how to implement a frontend and backend system using the best practiced methods. My goal is to write a Full-stack web application that not only loads instantly(almost) but is also well documented, aesthetically pleasing, and effectively displays my portfolio.

I want my website to show **why** I am pursuing Data Science. I deeply appreciate any feedback or advice about my website because I know there are constant improvements and changes in the ways we code.

## About

Building my Full-stack progressive web application - Aiming for near instant load times

*Disclaimer: This README is mostly to help myself remember why I used what I used. I do not think the code is especially unique or difficult to repoduce. It is merely a practice for a budding software engineer such as myself*

## Installation
**TODO**
**Will create a more thorough guide of how to install after finishing project**
Probably using yarn to quick install all Dependencies needed. Will also be implementing Greenkeeper to help keep dependencies updated as painlessly as possible.

## Documentation

Each section below documents why I used the tools I used and how I used them. These are just the tools I found most relevent and worthwhile to learn my first project, but not necessarily the best.

  - Structure:
    - [React](#react)
    - [Node.js](#node.js)
    - [Express.js](#express.js)
  -  Styling:
    - [Semantic UI React](#semantic-UI-React)
  - Configuration Tools:
    - [Babel](babel)
    - [Webpack](#webpack)
    - [Nodemon](#nodemon)
    - [ESLint](#eslint) (Airbnb)

### React

I conducted a decent amount of research to decide between using Angular or [React](https://reactjs.org/). Ultimately, it felt that React is the generally more recommended structure for my first web app. As well as, an excuse to learn how to use Javascript more efficiently. React and Node.js seemed to be more often requested by job listings as well making it a great first thing to learn. Although, realistically I think the fundamental differences are miniscule and I could have used either to accomplish my tasks.

### Node.js
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

### Semantic UI React

I decided to use [Semantic UI React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/) after reading [this article](https://medium.com/@Preda/semantic-ui-for-good-looking-looking-elements-5e6645787e99) by [Preda A](https://medium.com/@Preda). I admire his work and think the content is always an interesting read. Semantic's styling has everything I need and plenty of integration with React which made it an easy choice to use.

### Babel

[Babel](https://babeljs.io/) allows us to load and implement various features in Javascript that might not be natively supported. From my readings, Babel seemed to be the most supported and recommended tool for supporting the platform I was building.

### Webpack

[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) is an incredible tool for bundling all of the Javascript in my project efficiently. There are many guides on code splitting and lazy loading that allow for quick web loading which was a key goal of this project.

### Nodemon
[Nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon)
**TODO**
### ESLint

[ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/about/) is a linting tool that allows for various configurations and styling rules. Deciding between an Airbnb config set and a Google config was difficult. It seemed odd that I would choose alternatives against Google every time but it just fit better for my styling. Take a look at the differences in [this article](https://medium.com/@uistephen/style-guides-for-linting-ecmascript-2015-eslint-common-google-airbnb-6c25fd3dff0).
